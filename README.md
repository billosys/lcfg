## Introduction


``lcfg`` is the library behind the ``lfe.config`` file.


## Dependencies

This library requires only that [LFE](https://github.com/rvirding/lfe) be
installed.


## Usage

This library is intented to be used by projects during their creation,
dependency download, compile, etc., phases. As such, this library should
be "bootstrapped" ([lfetool](https://github.com/lfe/lfetool) uses it and
installs it into ``~/.lfe/deps``).

Usage is the same as any other Erlang or LFE library :-)

```cl
